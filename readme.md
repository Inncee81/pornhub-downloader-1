#Pornhub category downloader
This runs on python so you'll have to download that.

To use this, you need to install something called youtube-dl. If you don't have this, the program will not work.

If you have pip, it can be installed with pip3 install youtube-dl


Please set the thread count to a factor of the downloaded video count. I don't know why this breaks the program, but it does.


#A notice to Windows users
I'm a linux user, so this was originally made for linux. When I ported this to work on windows as well, there are several bugs which aren't in the linux version. I don't have an apple device, so I haven't tested this on apple devices. I'm prettu sure it'll work just fine because OS X is based on unix and linux commands are based on unix commands.
