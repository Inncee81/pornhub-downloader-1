#Pornhub category downloader
This runs on python so you'll have to download that.

Please note that all the testing so far has been done in linux, so there's a pretty good chance that this will break on windows, although it shouldn't.

To use this, you need to install something called youtube-dl. If you don't have this, the program will not work. Yes, it was made to download youtube videos but it also works on pornhub for some reason.

If you have pip, it can be installed with pip3 install youtube-dl


Please set the thread count to a factor of the downloaded video count. I don't know why this breaks the program, but it does.

Also, every once in a while this program will download a video which isn't in the specified categories, I don't know why that happens.


#A notice to Windows users
I'm a linux user, so this was originally made for linux. When I ported this to work on windows as well, there are several bugs which aren't in the linux version. I don't have an apple device, so I haven't tested this on apple devices. I'm prettu sure it'll work just fine because OS X is based on unix and linux commands are based on unix commands.
