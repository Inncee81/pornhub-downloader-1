#Pornhub category downloader
This runs on python so you'll have to download that.


To use this, you need to install something called youtube-dl. If you don't have this, the program will not work. Yes, it was made to download youtube videos but it also works on pornhub for some reason.

If you have pip, it can be installed with pip3 install youtube-dl


Please set the thread count to a factor of the downloaded video count. I don't know why this breaks the program, and it might work on Windows, but it doesn't work on Linux.
